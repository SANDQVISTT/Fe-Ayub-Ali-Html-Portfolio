              August 23, 1978 â€“ January 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time,[3][4][5][6] Bryant won five NBA championships, was an 18-time All-Star, a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP. Bryant also led the NBA in scoring twice, and ranks fourth in league all-time regular season and postseason scoring. He was posthumously voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020.Bryant was called "one of the greatest players in the history of our game" by NBA commissioner Adam Silver,[367] and The New York Times wrote that he had "one of the most decorated careers in the history of the sport."[367] Reuters called him "arguably the best player of his generation",[340] while both Sporting News and TNT named him their NBA player of the decade for the 2000s.[368][369] In 2008 and again in 2016, ESPN ranked him the second-greatest shooting guard of all time after Jordan.[345][370] Players including Kevin Durant,[371] Dirk Nowitzki,[372] Dwyane Wade,[307] and Derrick Rose called Bryant their generation's version of Jordan.[373][374] The Press-Enterprise described Bryant as "maybe the greatest Laker in the organization's history".[375] He was the Lakers' all-time leading scorer, and his five titles are tied for the most in franchise history.[376] Both numbers he wore during his career, 8 and 24, were retired by the Lakers on December 18, 2017.[377] In his first year of eligibility, Bryant was named a finalist for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, weeks after his death,[378] before being elected a couple of months later in April 2020.[379] His formal induction was delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
