He played 15 seasons in the NBA, winning six championships with the Chicago Bulls. f> He is the principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series Many of Jordan's contemporaries have said that Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.[199] In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century, above Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali.[215] Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press' December 1999 list of 20th century athletes.[216] In addition, the Associated Press voted him the greatest basketball player of the 20th century.[217] Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times.[218] In the September 1996 issue of Sport, which was the publication's 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.[.
