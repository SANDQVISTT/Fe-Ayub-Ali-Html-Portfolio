          <h1>Stephen Curry</h1>
          <p>
            Curry is widely considered to be the greatest shooter in NBA history.[2][217][218] He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring teams, from high school to the NBA, to regularly utilize the three-point shot.[3][4][5] Analysts have referred to him as "the Michael Jordan of the three-point era," stating that he did for the three-point shot what Jordan did for the dunk.[219][220][221] The Guardian's Robert O'Connell cites Curry's February 27, 2013 game against the New York Knicks, in which he made 11 of 13 shots from behind the arc en route for a 54-point performance, as the start of the three-point era.[222] The era has been referred to as "The Steph Effect"[5] and "the NBA's Three-Point Revolution.Before Curry, shooting behind the three-point line was more of a novelty, an occasional way of scoring.[218][224] Catch and shoot players existed, but Curry's success inspired the league to abandon physical play around the basket and to embrace a pace and space and three-point shooting style.[224] The increase in three-point shooting is partly due to NBA teams incorporating it in their attempts to defeat the Warriors or copy the Warriors' style of play, and to young people wanting to imitate Curry's shooting range.[5][222] Although this has led to players becoming good at or improving their three-point shot, it has also set unrealistic standards because Curry's range is unique.[5] Curry regularly takes shots from between 30 and 35 feet.[218] He shoots 54 percent from this range, while the NBA makes 35 percent of its threes overall and under 22 percent from between 30 and 35 feet.[218] He can make the shots with elite ball handling, off the dribble, and often with an extremely quick release, from anywhere on the court and with one or more defenders on him.[224] Curry said that he is sure coaches tell their high school players that shooting the way he does takes work and time.[5] Jesse Dougherty of The Washington Post stated that "coaches have to explain that while Curry's skill set is something to aspire to, his game is built on fundamentals" and that "while the Warriors have become the NBA's gold standard and make all those social-media-bound plays, the root of their success is ball movement."[5]
